## R2B: Return to Base - Plot and Characters
 
The movie begins with Tae-hun performing a dangerous stunt at an air show, which impresses the crowd but angers his superiors. He is transferred to a combat unit led by Cheol-hui, who is strict and disciplined. Tae-hun does not fit in well with the other pilots, who are more experienced and serious. He also meets Se-young, a beautiful and smart mechanic who works on the planes.
 
One day, Tae-hun and Cheol-hui are sent on a routine patrol mission, but they encounter a North Korean fighter jet that fires at them. They manage to evade the attack, but lose contact with one of their teammates, Park Dae-seo. They suspect that he was shot down and captured by the enemy. They report the incident to their commander, who orders them to stand by and wait for further instructions.
 
However, Tae-hun is restless and wants to rescue Park Dae-seo. He convinces Se-young to help him hack into the military database and locate his friend's position. He then steals a plane and flies to North Korea, followed by Cheol-hui and the rest of the unit. They find Park Dae-seo alive and free him from his captors. However, they also discover that the North Koreans have a secret nuclear weapon that they plan to use against South Korea.
 
Tae-hun and Cheol-hui decide to destroy the weapon before it can be launched. They engage in a fierce dogfight with the North Korean pilots, who are led by a mysterious ace known as "Scorpio". They manage to destroy the weapon, but at a great cost. Tae-hun and Cheol-hui return to South Korea as heroes, but also mourn the loss of their comrades.
 
The movie ends with Tae-hun and Se-young kissing on the runway, while Cheol-hui watches them with a smile.
